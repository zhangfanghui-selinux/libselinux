This contains the shared library source code and a simple Makefile.
The library saves lots of typing context strings etc. when playing with
the examples. See the config/notebook.conf file that will be installed in the
$HOME directory for details. You can edit this file to your requirements.

The source code consists of:

	notebook-lib.c - Containing the functions to extract the relevant
					 information from the $HOME/notebook.conf file.

	rgb-color-conv.c -	Containing routines that convert RGB colours to
						those suitable for displaying strings in a virtual
						terminal session. These are only used by
						selinux_raw_context_to_color_example2.c
						to show context strings in colour.
						There is a sample secolor.conf file in the
						config directory that can be used for testing.

The Makefile will:
1) Build the libnotebook.so library and install it either in /usr/lib 
   or /usr/lib64

2) Install the config/notebook.conf file in the $HOME directory.
   This file contains the context, class etc. strings that are passed to 
   the various programs available in the notebook source.
